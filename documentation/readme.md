This is a simple strategy game in which you command an army and aim to defeat the defence structure in each level to proceed to the next level.

### How to play:

In each level, there are some enemy defence structures to the right side of border. Your objective is to destroy all the defence structures in a level to win the battle, and proceed to the next level. However, when your troops get near to the enemy territory, they would be met with strong enemy resistance. You have to command your army into the battle. Your strategy would help them conquer all enemy positions and emerge victorious.

The screen is divided into 3 sections. The top section contains the cards, showing the troops you have under your command. Click on a card to select it. Note: Limited number of troops for each card. No unlimited manpower.  
The left section contains the deployment area. Here you can deploy your troops by clicking with your mouse. Upon deployment, troops would charge immediately towards enemy.  The right section contains enemy territory. You cannot deploy troops in this area. This region contains enemy defence structures. Your objective is to destroy all these enemy structures to capture this land and proceed to the next battle.
